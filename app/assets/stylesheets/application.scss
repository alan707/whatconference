 * Application CSS file
 *
 * Don't include Bootstrap directly in here because otherwise the file
 * will have too many styles and the styles after the 4095'th one will
 * be ignored by Internet Explorer.
 *
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css,
 * which will include all the files listed below.
 *
 * Use Sprocket =require and =require_tree in this file instead of SASS
 * @import directives. Otherwise, whenever a single file changes the
 * entire CSSS must be regenerated.
 *
 * Include specific SASS @import in the necessary SASS files.

 *= require bootstrap-datepicker3

 * Bower CSS files
